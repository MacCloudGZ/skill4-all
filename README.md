# Skill4-All

Skill4-All is a simple project designed as my first experiment with CSS manipulation using JavaScript. The entire project is contained in a single HTML file to address the URL buffering problem.

## Notes

At the time of creating this project, I was not familiar with CSS animations. As a result, I used JavaScript to manipulate animations. This approach has its advantages and disadvantages.

### Pros

- Beautiful continuous animations with fluid transitions.
- Suitable for large projects with multiple developers collaborating on the same codebase.

### Cons

- The code can be difficult to debug and configure if bugs are found.
- Not ideal for independent single developers due to complexity.

This project was an experimental learning experience, and I have since gained a better understanding of CSS animations and project structuring.
